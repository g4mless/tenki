# Tenki

Simple and lightweight weather app without clutter and catchy ui build using Flutter and Powered by Open-Meteo


## Why This Even Exist ?
I don't like the default weather apps that come with most Android phones nowadays. Thereâ€™s too much going on, and I feel overwhelmed just opening the app. Most of the UIs are designed to be catchy, which actually makes it harder for me to get the information I need. That's why I made this app for myself.
## Features

- Find your location manually or use location services to find it automatically.
- Weather Temperature & Forecast
- Dark/light mode based on your system settings
- Awful material design 3 implementation
